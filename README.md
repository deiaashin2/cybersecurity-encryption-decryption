# File Encryption & Decryption Program  

## Overview  
encryption program written in **Python**.  
The project involves reading text files as input, applying the encryption process, and generating an encrypted output file. Additionally, it also have a decryption mechanism that can reverse the encryption and return the original text.

## The Algorithm 
1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   - Substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
2. **Transposition Ciphers**  
   - Shifting the positions of the characters of the plaintext to create the ciphertext.   

**Decryption** inverts both steps in exact order using the same key.
